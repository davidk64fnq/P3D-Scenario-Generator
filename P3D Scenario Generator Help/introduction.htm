<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Using SimDirector to create scenarios requires an investment
of time and energy to familiarise yourself with the tool. It's not for the
feint hearted! This application hides that complexity at the expense of restricting
you to a set of predefined scenario types. You choose the scenario type, a
location, an aircraft and scenario specific parameters. The program creates
equivalent output files to that which would be produced had you created the
scenario using SimDirector. In Prepar3D you load the created scenario just as
you would a saved flight and start flying.</p>
<br>
<p>To fly another instance of that scenario type, say at a
different location or with different scenario specific parameters, return to
this application and generate a new set of files with the modified parameters. Note
that Prepar3D allows you to change the time, weather, or aircraft once you have
loaded the scenario (that is you are actually in the plane on the runway) without
"breaking" the scenario.</p>
