<h1>Runway</h1>

<p>The list of runways corresponds to the default airports that
ship with Prepar3D V5.1. It has been generated using the freeware
"MakeRunways" program version 5.11 by Pete Dowson. The list is
alphabetical showing airport ICAO and runway id in parentheses. If you choose a
random runway the generated circuit may include gates embedded in terrain if
the airport happens to be in a hilly location! The program doesn't display
location information for the selected airport in order to preserve the element
of surprise where a random strip is chosen.</p>
<br>
<p>The runway data is derived from a file produced by the
"MakeRunways" program named "runways.xml". To select add-on Prepar3D V5.1
airports download a copy of "MakeRunways" and generate a copy of "runways.xml"
that reflects the airports installed on your PC. Place the "runways.xml" file
in the same directory as the P3D Scenario Generator program files and it will
be used in preference to the default "runways.xml" list.</p>
