<h1>Scenario</h1>

<p>The following scenario type is implemented:</p>

<h2>Circuit</h2>

<p>The circuit is left-handed and consists of eight gates. Four
pairs of gates mark the start and finish of four successive ninety degree turns
from the initial runway heading. The gate positions for each turn are based on
the nominated speed divided by 180. So a plane with a cruise speed of 90 knots
is assigned a turn radius of 0.5 miles. The distance between gate pairs is set
on the circuit tab. Three gate heights are configurable: gates 1, 3 to 6, and 8. Gates 3 to 6 are all set at the same specified height while the height of gates 2 and 7 are calculated by the program based on a steady climb(descent) between gates 1(6) and 3(8). This scenario commences on the runway threshold and requires the pilot
to take off and fly through the eight gates in
sequence before landing on the same runway and coming to a complete stop to end
the scenario. The circuit tab allows you to customise the location of the four
turns, the heights and planned cruising speed. The default button resets the
values based on the "[Reference Speeds] cruise_speed"
value from the selected "aircraft.cfg" file.</p>

<h2>Photos</h2>

<p>This is planned to be a randomly generated flight based on
an Internet website that displays geo-referenced photos. As you reach a gate
location a panel would open showing the photo for that latitude and longitude.</p>
