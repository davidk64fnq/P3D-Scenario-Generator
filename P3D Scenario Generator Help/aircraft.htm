<h1>Aircraft</h1>

<p>Pressing the aircraft button allows you to navigate to the "aircraft.cfg" file for the aircraft you wish to fly. The
program verifies the aircraft isn't an artificial intelligence one by checking
for the presence of one or more panel subfolders. A list of available textures
for the selected aircraft is displayed. Both default and add-on aircraft can be
selected by navigating to the appropriate "aircraft.cfg"
file.</p>
