        <h2>Aircraft</h2>
        <p>Pressing the "aircraft.cfg" button allows you to navigate to the "aircraft.cfg" file for the aircraft you wish to fly. The program verifies the aircraft isn't an artificial intelligence one by checking for the presence of one or more panel subfolders. A list of available textures for the selected aircraft is displayed. Both default and add-on aircraft can be
        selected by navigating to the appropriate "aircraft.cfg" file.</p>
