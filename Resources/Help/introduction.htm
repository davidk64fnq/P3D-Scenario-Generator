        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Using SimDirector to create scenarios requires an investment of time and energy to familiarise yourself with the tool. It's not for the feint hearted! For example the diagram below shows the object visualisation in SimDirector for a Photo Tour scenario generated by P3D Scenario Generator.

            P3D Scenario Generator hides that complexity at the expense of restricting you to a set of predefined scenario types. You choose the scenario type, a location, an aircraft and scenario specific parameters. P3D Scenario Generator creates equivalent output files to that which would be produced had you created the scenario using the SimDirector interface. In Prepar3D you load the created scenario just as you would a saved flight and start flying.

            To fly another instance of that scenario type, for example at a different location or with different scenario specific parameters, return to P3D Scenario Generator and generate a new set of files with the modified parameters. <strong>Note: </strong> Prepar3D allows you to change the time, weather, or aircraft without "breaking" the scenario, once you have loaded the scenario (that is you are actually in the plane on the runway)
