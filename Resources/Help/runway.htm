        <h2>Runway</h2>
        <p>
            The list of runways corresponds to the default airports included with Prepar3D V5.1. It was generated using the freeware <a href="http://fsuipc.com/" title="fsuipc.com" target="_blank">"MakeRunways"</a> program (version 5.11) provided by Pete & John Dowson. The list is alphabetical showing airport ICAO and runway id in parentheses. P3D Scenario Generator doesn't display location information for the selected airport in order to preserve the element of surprise where a random strip is chosen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The runway data is derived from a file produced by the "MakeRunways" program named "runways.xml". To include add-on airports in the available list, download a copy of "MakeRunways" and generate a copy of "runways.xml" that reflects the airports installed on your PC. This involves using a utility included with "MakeRunways" called "LorbySceneryExport", details are provided in the "MakeRwys README.pdf" file. Place the generated "runways.xml" file in the same directory as the P3D Scenario Generator program files and it will be used in preference to the default "runways.xml" list incorporated in the P3D Scenario Generator executable.
