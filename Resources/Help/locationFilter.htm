        <h2>Location filter</h2>
        <p>
           The purpose of the location filters is to control the location in which a scenario is generated. For example you might wish to generate a scenario to fly using the Orbx True Earth Netherlands scenery. You would set up a location filter favourite that had a filter on country for the Netherlands.
