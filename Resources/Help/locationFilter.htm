        <h2>Location filter</h2>
        <p>
           The purpose of the location filters is to define the location in which a scenario is generated. For example you might wish to generate a scenario to fly using the Orbx True Earth Netherlands scenery. You would set up a location filter favourite that had a filter on country for the Netherlands. When editing location favourite filter values first select the location favourite from the Favourites combobox then make changes to country, state, and city using the relevant combo boxes.
        </p>
        <h4>Favourites combobox</h4>
        <p>
           Click the dropdown arrow and select an existing favourite. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To create (copy) a new favourite, select an existing favourite, type in the new favourite name and press the enter key. The new favourite country/state/city filters will be initialised to the values of the existing favourite. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To rename a favourite, select an existing favourite, type in the new favourite name and press the enter key, then select the old favourite name and press the delete key. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To delete a favourite, select an existing favourite, and press the delete key. You cannot delete the last remaining favourite in the list.
        </p>
        <h4>Country, State and City comboboxes</h4>
        <p>
           The following help is written in terms of country but applies equally to state and city.
        </p>
        <p>
           To add a country to the currently selected favourite, click the country combobox dropdown arrow and and then drag to the desired country, then press the enter key. Alternatively typing a letter will take you to the first country in the list beginning with that letter.
        </p>
        <p>
           To delete a country from the currently selected favourite, click the country combobox dropdown arrow and and then drag to the desired country, then press the delete key. 
        </p>
        <p>
           To delete ALL countries from the currently selected favourite, click the country combobox dropdown arrow and and then drag to the "None" entry (first in the list), then press the ENTER key. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <b>Note:</b> Changes are only made once the enter or delete key is pressed. Selecting a country without pressing enter or delete will have no effect on the currently selected favourite. 
        </p>
        <h4>Random button</h4>
        <p>
            Click on this to get a randomly selected location favourite.   
        </p>
        <h4>Favourite display field</h4>
        <p>
            Hover over the field adjacent to the random button to see a summary of the countries, states, and cities for the currently selected location favourite. The summary display remains for 5 seconds, if you select a different location favourite during that time you will need to wait till it clears before you can see the new summary.
        </p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <p>
            <b>Scenario:</b> You decide to create a location favourite for the Orbx True Earth products as you own all of them and for your next scenario you only want to fly in that scenery.
