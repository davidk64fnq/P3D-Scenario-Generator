            The circuit is left-handed and consists of eight gates. Four pairs of gates mark the start and finish of four ninety degree turns from the initial runway heading. The gate positions for each turn are based on the nominated speed divided by 180. So a plane with a cruise speed of 90 knots is assigned a turn radius of 0.5 miles. The distance between gate pairs is set on the circuit tab. Three gate heights are configurable: gates 1, 3 to 6, and 8. Gates 3 to 6 are all set at the same specified height while the height of gates 2 and 7 are calculated by the program based on a steady climb(descent) between gates 1(6) and 3(8). This scenario commences on the runway threshold and requires the pilot to take off and fly through the eight gates in sequence before landing on the same runway and coming to a complete stop to end the scenario. The circuit tab allows you to customise the location of the four turns, the heights and planned cruising speed. The default button resets the values based on the "[Reference Speeds] cruise_speed" value from the selected "aircraft.cfg" file. <strong>Note:</strong> if you choose a random runway the generated circuit may include gates embedded in terrain if the airport happens to be in a hilly location!
