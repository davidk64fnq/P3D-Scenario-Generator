        <h2>Scenario Title</h2>
        <p>
            When P3D Scenario Generator generates the scenario files they are stored in the users "P3D v5 Files" folder in a sub-folder with the name you specify as the scenario title. In the example below the scenario title was "test1" and P3D Scenario Generator has stored the generated scenario files in a sub-folder called "test1".

            To fly a generated scenario, start Prepar3D and navigate to the load scenario screen as shown in the diagram below.

            Included in the list of available scenarios is the scenario title for scenarios generated by P3D Scenario Generator. In the diagram below the generated "test1" scenario is highlighted.

            If you attempt to generate a scenario with a scenario title that corresponds to an already existing sub-folder in the "P3D v5 Files" folder, P3D Scenario Generator will display an error dialog and prevent you from doing so. You can either choose a different scenario title or delete the existing sub-folder first. <strong>Note:</strong> if Prepar3D is running you will need to shut it down before you will be able to delete sub-folders in the "P3D v5 Files" folder.
