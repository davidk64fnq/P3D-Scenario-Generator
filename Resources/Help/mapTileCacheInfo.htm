    <h2>Map Tile Cache Info</h2>
    <p>
        Scenario map images are constructed from OSM map tiles downloaded from the Internet. While the map tiles are available free to use for non commercial applications, there is a requirement to register with a map tile server before you can access them. All of the scenario map tiles are stored in a cache folder. This folder is used to store the map tiles that have been downloaded from the server, so that they can be reused in future scenarios without needing to download them again.

    <h4>Server / API key</h4>
    <p>
        Users of this program are required to register with the free OpenStreetMap (OSM) map tile provider <a href="https://rapidapi.com/" title="rapidapi.com" target="_blank">Rapid</a> to obtain an API key. This key is used to access the map tiles from the server. The program will not work without a valid API key. Follow these instructions to register with the OSM map tile server to obtain your API key and store it on the settings tab:
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Go to this website: <a href="https://rapidapi.com" title="rapidapi.com" target="_blank">Rapid</a></li>
        <li>Click on the "Sign Up" button, usually in top right corner, and complete the registration process.</li>
        <li>Once registered, sign into the website if you are not already signed in.</li>
        <li>Once signed in, look for a search box with "Search APIs" written in it.</li>
        <li>Type in the string "MapTiles" and press enter. There will be a number of results containing the string "MapTiles", click on the result that ONLY contains that string.</li>
        <li>After selecting the 'MapTiles' API, look for a field labeled X-RapidAPI-Key. The key value is a long string of letters and numbers, e.g., "d9de94c22fmsh6dc07cd7103e683p12be01jsn7014f38e1975".</li>
        <li>The best (and only) place to copy the key value is from within the "Code Snippets" area.</li>
        <li>Click in the "Server / API key" text field on the settings tab of the program and paste in the API key value.</li>
    </ol>
